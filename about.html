                <h3><span>Who am I</span><br>HELLO</h3>
                <p>I’m Hassan Muktar, a passionate and creative individual with
                    a strong interest in UI design, graphics, video editing, and
                    branding. I believe that good design is more than just
                    visuals — it’s about telling a story, solving problems, and
                    creating experiences that people can connect with.

                    Currently, I’m a Computer Science student at Northwest
                    University, Kano, where I’m gaining both the technical
                    knowledge and creative foundation to bring digital ideas to
                    life. Studying computer science has helped me better
                    understand how things work behind the scenes, allowing me to
                    design smarter and more user-focused solutions.

                    My journey into the creative world started with a love for
                    visual storytelling. Over time, I taught myself how to
                    design beautiful interfaces, create compelling graphics, and
                    edit videos that capture attention. I also have experience
                    in building brand identities — from logos to full brand
                    systems — helping individuals and businesses stand out in a
                    crowded digital space.

                    I’m always learning and experimenting with new tools,
                    trends, and technologies. Whether it’s wireframing a mobile
                    app, designing a flyer, editing a promo video, or developing
                    a brand strategy, I give every project my full energy and
                    creativity.

                    Beyond design and tech, I’m someone who values teamwork,
                    continuous growth, and meaningful connections. I enjoy
                    collaborating with others, exchanging ideas, and turning
                    vision into reality.</p>
